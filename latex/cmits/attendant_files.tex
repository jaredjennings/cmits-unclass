\chapter{Attendant files}
\label{AttendantFiles}
Here follow the files used by the policy.

Wherever you see \verb![WRAP]! at the end of a line, that line was wrapped
in order to fit on the page; if you find yourself in the unfortunate
position of typing that line into a computer, do not type [WRAP] and do
not start a new line. Lines not ending with \verb![WRAP]! end with a
newline in the original text of the file.

Wherever you see something like \verb![UNICODE \u5678 MAYBE SOME WORDS]!,
the original text of the file contained a Unicode character which could
not be reproduced exactly in this document. If the Unicode character
database includes a description of the character, it is included; if not,
only the character's identity is included.
