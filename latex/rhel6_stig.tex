\chapter{RHEL 6 STIG Compliance}
\label{RHEL6STIGCompliance}

This chapter has to do with the compliance of Linux machines controlled by
this policy, and administrators performing the procedures written here,
with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 STIG \cite{rhel6-stig}.

In the compliance index of this document you can find a section for the RHEL 6 STIG.
All requirements directly and completely implemented by automated
application of this policy are listed in that index as ``implemented.''
In places where the SRG imposes
policy demands on the actions of administrators, those demands are passed
on in \S\ref{Procedures}. All other requirements are discussed in another
section below.

Where RHEL defaults to the correct behavior, but it is simple to write
automated policy that will fix anything that is broken, we do that, in an
attempt to ensure that RHEL 6 hosts are not only compliant at rollout, but
remain compliant over time, and to ensure that noncompliance is rare
enough to draw attention where it is warranted.
